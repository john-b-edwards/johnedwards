      <description>Introduction The Advent of Code (AOC) is a series of programming problems that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th, each problem more challenging than the last. As a means of practicing my Julia skills, I decided to try to tackle the AOC this year using just Julia! This is my write-up of the first week of AOC problems that I completed&amp;ndash;as these problems progressively get more difficult, I anticipate splitting these posts into chunks that cover fewer days but are more comprehensive.</description>

Easier said than done! You can go to YouTube and try to scrub through hours of film to see plays, but 1) that takes a ton of time and 2) means interfacing with the game in a meaningful way beyond manipulating a spreadsheet, which no self-respecting analytics nerd would ever do,,,</description>

      <description>I recently participated in a Kaggle community competition where the objective was to predict the point value of a word played on the 20th turn of a Scrabble game given a dataset of Scrabble games played on Woogles.io , an online Scrabble website. After learning a lot about neural networks and Julia, I managed to swing first place! Below is my write-up of my solution, which also represents my first serious foray into working with Julia.</description>
