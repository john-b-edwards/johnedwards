      <description>The following was originally published on the CFBD Blog and has been reproduced here with edits for clarity.
As Bill covered earlier this season , calculating strength-of-schedule adjusted metrics like SRS are a little tricky given how few non-conference games teams play this year. While I think his technique for conference-based SRS is a great attempt at a really difficult problem, I think there is some value in discussing alternative approaches to evaluating team strength this year that do not struggle with the same singularity issues as SRS.</description>
