      <description>Introduction There is no more frustrating feeling than finishing just shy of a podium position in a Kaggle competition. Those precious competition points were right there! If only you had just a slightly better log loss! Alas, you exhausted every tool in your data science toolkit, and that was the best you could do. Unless&amp;hellip; there was another way to get even better performance out of your models. Something so absurdly simple to implement that it felt almost like hacking the leaderboard.</description>

      <description>Our approach is ensemble the shit out of everything. We will hold out the 2015-2019 games for validation purposes. We will prepare and optimize two sets of models - one, an ensemble of general team strength features trained on 1985-2014 games, and two - an ensemble of general team strength features + adjusted ratings based on box-score data trained on 2002-2014 games. Let&amp;rsquo;s prepare the first approach.
