      <description>As we reach the end of the 2021-22 college football season (the national championship game is unfolding on my TV as I type this), I wanted to take a look back at my performance in the College Football Data predictions contest . Minimum 400 games picked (not count the NCG, but it should not affect my performance) (I picked 726 games total, for reference), I finished:
 1st in straight-up picks 3rd in ATS picks 1st in absolute error 4th in mean squared error  So I did pretty well, especially for someone who picked as many games as I did!</description>
