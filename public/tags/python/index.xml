      <description>Our approach is ensemble the shit out of everything. We will hold out the 2015-2019 games for validation purposes. We will prepare and optimize two sets of models - one, an ensemble of general team strength features trained on 1985-2014 games, and two - an ensemble of general team strength features + adjusted ratings based on box-score data trained on 2002-2014 games. Let&amp;rsquo;s prepare the first approach.
