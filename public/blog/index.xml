      <description>I recently participated in a Kaggle community competition where the objective was to predict the point value of a word played on the 20th turn of a Scrabble game given a dataset of Scrabble games played on Woogles.io , an online Scrabble website. After learning a lot about neural networks and Julia, I managed to swing first place! Below is my write-up of my solution, which also represents my first serious foray into working with Julia.</description>

      <description>As we reach the end of the 2021-22 college football season (the national championship game is unfolding on my TV as I type this), I wanted to take a look back at my performance in the College Football Data predictions contest . Minimum 400 games picked (not count the NCG, but it should not affect my performance) (I picked 726 games total, for reference), I finished:
 1st in straight-up picks 3rd in ATS picks 1st in absolute error 4th in mean squared error  So I did pretty well, especially for someone who picked as many games as I did!</description>

      <title>2021 March Madness Kaggle Solution</title>

      <description>Our approach is ensemble the shit out of everything. We will hold out the 2015-2019 games for validation purposes. We will prepare and optimize two sets of models - one, an ensemble of general team strength features trained on 1985-2014 games, and two - an ensemble of general team strength features + adjusted ratings based on box-score data trained on 2002-2014 games. Let&amp;rsquo;s prepare the first approach.

      <description>The following was originally published on the CFBD Blog and has been reproduced here with edits for clarity.
This is the second and final part of a series on implementing LRMC rankings for CFB! This entry presupposes you are familiar with the mathematical concepts behind LRMC. To view part one, which covers these concepts, click here.
When we last left off, we covered how LRMC works and how to implement it mathematically.</description>

As Bill covered earlier this season , calculating strength-of-schedule adjusted metrics like SRS are a little tricky given how few non-conference games teams play this year. While I think his technique for conference-based SRS is a great attempt at a really difficult problem, I think there is some value in discussing alternative approaches to evaluating team strength this year that do not struggle with the same singularity issues as SRS.</description>
