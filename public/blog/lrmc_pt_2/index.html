<p>This is the second and final part of a series on implementing LRMC rankings for CFB! This entry presupposes you are familiar with the mathematical concepts behind LRMC. To view part one, which covers these concepts, click here.</p>
<p>When we last left off, we covered how LRMC works and how to implement it mathematically. With our understanding of LRMC, we are now prepared to implement a version of LRMC computationally for ranking CFB teams. To start with, let&rsquo;s fire up our Python notebook.</p>

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import math
</code></pre>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll grab a 6 year sample of CFB games, from 2015-2020 (you&rsquo;ll see why we&rsquo;re grabbing so many games in a second), then filter out any games not against BCS opponents.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">seasons = [cfbd.GamesApi().get_games(year=iteryear, season_type='both') for iteryear in range(2015,2021)]
games = [game for season in seasons for game in season]

games_df = pd.DataFrame().from_records([

<p>Our first task is to calculate <em>r</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> for each of these games - the probability that the home team is better than the away team given their margin of victory.</p>
<p>For college basketball, estimating this value is quite easy with logistic regression â€“  by virtue of conference home-and-home games, we can simply take all home-team margin of victories and run a logistic regression on the away game of the series to determine the odds of the home team winning on the road, then adjust for home court advantage. But since two teams playing each other twice in one season in college football are quite rare (let alone two teams playing a home-and-home series), we have to take a different approach. For college football, Kolbush and Sokol instead use a common-opponent approach for estimating <em>r</em><sub><em>x</em></sub><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Essentially, for a given game, we can look at the opponents Team A and Team B both played over the course of the season, and estimate the odds that Team A is better than Team B based on their win percentages against common opponents. Let&rsquo;s walk through an example.</p>

Miami's common opponent WPCT: 0.4
</code></pre>
<p>Virginia Tech won 60% of their games against their common opponents, and Miami won 40%. Per Kolbush and Sokol&rsquo;s approach, this renders our calculus rather simple. Let <em>p</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> be the winning percentage of the home team (<em>j</em>) against common opponents between <em>j</em> and the away team (<em>i</em>), and <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> be the winning percentage of <em>i</em> against common opponents, then  <em>r</em><sub><em>x</em></sub> becomes:</p>
<p>$$
{\frac {p_j + (1 - p_i)} {2}} = {\frac {0.4 + (1 - 0.6)} {2}} = 0.4
$$</p>
<p>There is a 40% approximated chance Miami is better than Virginia Tech based on their common opponents.</p>
<p>To obtain a smooth estimate, we&rsquo;ll perform this for every game where teams had common opponents in a season, compile the point differentials for those games, then run a weighted logistic regression on those games (remember, our 40% estimate is currently independent of point differential â€“ we wish to translate point differential into this estimate!). Our weights will be the total number of games played against common opponents for the teams in a given game<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do this for the 2015-2018 seasons to estimate coefficients for the 2019 season (Kolbush and Sokol also used four prior seasons of data to estimate coefficients for a given season<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>). We&rsquo;ll also filter out neutral site games so we can get a better approximation for home field advantage.</p>

<p>Now, we&rsquo;ll use our data to make a logistic regression model. Okay, I lied, it&rsquo;s not a strict logistic regression model â€“ because we have a series of continuous probabilities to train on rather than a series of 1s and 0s (which a logistic regression model is usually trained upon), we&rsquo;re going to use the logit transformation to linearize our data, then run a weighted linear regression model, then undo the logit transformation to obtain probabilities for <em>r</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>. Before we do that, we&rsquo;re going transform any probabilities of 100% to 90% and 0% to 10% â€“ the logit transformation can&rsquo;t handle these specific probabilities, and speaking realistically, it would be difficult to project anyone as having a 100% chance of beating a given opponent regardless of their margins of victory against other opponents<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Remember that for a linear regression, we find our coefficients in the form <em>y</em> = <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>. Since <em>y</em> is logit transformed, we can undo the transformation like so:</p>
<p>$$
{\frac {e^{(ax + b)}} {1 + e^{(ax + b)}}}
$$</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to that Virginia Tech/Miami game. Based on the point differential of the game and our model, what are the odds that Miami was better than Virginia Tech?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(math.exp(a * -7 + b) / (1 + math.exp(a * -7 + b)))
</code></pre>
<pre><code>0.43455413139478277
</code></pre>
<p>Not too far off from our original estimate of 40%!</p>
<p>We can also quickly calculate the expected home field advantage from these coefficients<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">h = (-b / a)
print(h)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>3.9782530029249448
</code></pre>
<p>So from 2015-2018, home field advantage appears to be worth about 4 points â€“ not too far off from the 2.5 estimate Bill has been using in his SRS calculations.</p>
<p>Now that we have our formula for estimating <em>r</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>, we can start building our Markov chain. Recall how we did this by hand in part one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To generate our transition matrix, we sum up for games involving a particular team (let&rsquo;s say, Team X) by team. In the row of Team X, we place each team&rsquo;s sum of rx in each team&rsquo;s corresponding column (including Team X). Then, we divide all of the values in the row by the number of games Team X played.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to implement this algorithmically for our 2019 dataset. First, let&rsquo;s grab our 2019 values.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">games_df_2019 = games_df.loc[games_df['season'] == 2019]

<p>These are some good looking rankings! Most importantly, it seems to be placing G6 teams in the sweet spot of where they usually end up year-to-year (10-3 UCF was also ranked 24th in the AP poll in 2019), which indicates that it&rsquo;s appropriately evaluating strength of schedule.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve finished with LRMC rankings with 2019 â€“ but how will they work in the messed-up year of 2020, when some teams are playing conference-only schedules? Let&rsquo;s find out. We&rsquo;ll re-run the same analysis but we&rsquo;ll adjust home field advantage for the weird-pandemic stuff, eyeballing it and dropping it by 2 points â€“ removing some to account for the impact of reduced or no crowd, but keeping some to account for rest/travel.</p>

<p>These ratings are obviously a little rough, for various reasons â€“ Buffalo has played just 4 games and thoroughly dominated their MAC-only opponents in three of them, and since our LRMC model doesn&rsquo;t account for sample size, they appear to be far better than they likely are â€“ but I think it is worth pointing out that the rest of the rankings are more than plausible, and what&rsquo;s more, this ratings system actually resolves instead of base SRS.</p>
<p>Further, this method is largely empirical â€“ the only manual adjustment we&rsquo;ve made is to our estimate of home field advantage; the rest of it has required no manual adjustments. <a href="https://blog.collegefootballdata.com/talking-tech-calculating-srs-in-a-pandemic/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Bill&rsquo;s conference-adjusted SRS values</a>
 are likely closest to what the top 25 ratings will look like, but this method is more robust in that it works with relatively few manual adjustments from year-to-year given the oddity of the 2020 season. I think there are advantages and disadvantages to either approach, and you should weigh those before applying the rating technique of your choosing. Still, LRMC, in both normal times and odd, is a powerful, useful tool for estimating team strength, and worthy of consideration for use in rankings.</p>

<p>If <em>j</em> has a common opponent winning percentage of 100% and <em>i</em> has a common opponent winning percentage of 0%, that difference is far less meaningful if <em>j</em> and <em>i</em> have just one game against a common opponent, and far more meaningful if <em>j</em> and <em>i</em> have 10+ combined games against common opponents.

<p>This is a little different from our calculation of home field advantage from part one â€“ in part one, we used home point differential to estimate road winning percentage for a given matchup (sx), then adjusted for home field advantage to find rx. But here, we fit home point differential on a location-neutral estimate of team strength, so there isn&rsquo;t an intermediate sx to deal with. In math terms, when sx = 50%, x / 2 = h, when rx = 50%, x = h. We use both of these steps in part one, but here we only need the second step.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
