I am a sports analyst/data scientist from Virginia Beach, VA, currently residing in Seattle, WA. I received my BS in Literature, Media, and Communications from Georgia Tech in 2019. I have previously worked as a contributing writer/analyst for a variety of websites, including The Athletic, and Sporting News, but have since moved to work in front offices, interning with the Baltimore Orioles before landing with the Seattle Mariners. I have served as an analyst and lead data scientist of pitching before landing in my current position as manager of data science for the team. In a past life, I also interned for NASA and my local public radio station.

In my spare time, I am a long distance runner (I ran the Seattle Marathon in 2023!), and I enjoy bar trivia, online card games (I used to play Hearthstone competitively in college!), and exploring Seattle's wonderful food scene.
