I am a sports analyst/data scientist from Virginia Beach, VA, currently residing in Seattle, WA. I received my bachelors in Literature, Media, and Communications from Georgia Tech in 2019. I have previously worked as a contributing writer/analyst for a variety of websites, including The Athletic, and Sporting News, but have since moved to work in front offices, interning with the Baltimore Orioles before landing in my current position as analyst for the Seattle Mariners. In a past life, I also interned for NASA and my local public radio station.

In my spare time, I am an avid tabletop gamer and a longtime D&D Dungeon Master, enjoy urban hiking, and reading/writing about politics.
